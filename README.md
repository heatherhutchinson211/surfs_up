# surfs_up
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to create two queries, one for the weather statistics for June and one for Decemeber, in order to see if a surf shop should be open year round.  This was done using a SQLite database and by creating a Flask application. 
## Results
After performing analysis on the temperature statistics, I was able to create summary statistics for the months of June and Decmeber as shown below. 

June:

December:

- As you can see, the mean temperature in June is 74, while it is only 71 in December.  This accounts for a 3 degree difference.
- Additionally,  The minimum temperature in June is 64, but it is only 56 in December.  This is an 8 degree change in the low temperatures between June and December.
- Finally,  the standard deviations between June and December only differ by 0.5. 
## Summary 
Overall, it seems as if the temperatures differ, but not to greatly.  The temperatures are similar enough that it seems like keeping the surf shop open year round would be substainable. However, in the future, it would be benefical to run additional queries to get more information.  It would be beneficial to run a query that analyzes perciptiation in the area in different months.  It would also be beneficial to run wind data queries to analyze weather people would actually be surfing during these times, despie the cooler weather.
